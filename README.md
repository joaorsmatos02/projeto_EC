Projecto 2

Dataset: An augmented and edited version of the Dataset QSAR biodegradation Data Set

DO NOT DOWNLOAD the Dataset from the UCI Repository - Use the edited and augmented version in this assignment (biodegradable_a.csv)
Aim:

    Students should provide the best possible classification models using whatever method covered in class
    Variable to Classify is Biodegradable
    Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one [Remember: everything else being similar, the simplest models should be preferred]

Processing notes

    Data is not normalized
    Data has categorical and continuous variables
    Data has missing values which should be handled accordingly
    Data has 41 columns, and not all are important

Objectives

    Produce the best Classification model
    For the best model, test different hyperparameters
    Identify the most significant features

Submission

Students should submit a ZIP file (no other compression algorithms allowed) with 2 documents

    PDF - Report with 5 pages MAXIMUM [aprox. 2500 words], containing
        Header:
            Group number
            Student names and ids
            how many hours each student contributed to the project
        Report text
            Introduction and Goals - brief description of the task, data and goals.
            Data processing - Briefly describe all data processing steps
            Variable selection - Describe the approach followed for variable selection
            Model results - should include a table with the statistics for the best models tested
            Hyperparameter tuning - briefly describe which parameters were tuned and how
            Discussion and Conclusions
        all sections can be supported by graphics 

    Notebook (or similar) with the source code and attached results that led to the report. This Notebook with outputs should never be larger than 12 pages [penalties will be applied]

Submission

    Submit on Moodle with one submission per group (week of May 15-19 on your TP)
